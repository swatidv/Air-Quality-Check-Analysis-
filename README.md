# Air-Quality-Check-Analysis- Dashbord

Created a air quality index dashboard using air quality dashboard. Will be able to understand which are those parameters are going to affect the air quality of a specific City or specific region, 
About air quality it is nothing related to oxygen, every single human
requires oxygen but along with oxygen there are also various other parameters like PM 2.5 PM 10 nitrogen levels thermal deide levels and so on if all of
those parameters or the indexes are going to be adequate then only it is sustainable for a human being to survive not only human being for all the animals
to survive there need to be a really good air quality so in this particular Dashbord we will be trying to understand which are those pollutants actually making our environment unstable and inhabitable.

About DATASET:
Data is from from a Indian Source 
We have various cities which are available in India there are continuous dates which are actually available here
and along with that PM 2.5 is a one of pollutant it's called as particle matters 2.5 similar to carbon dioxide or carbon monooxide these are particle matters which basically means these are very tiny objects which will be around us and we won't be able to see that from our Naked Eyes similarly PM
particle matters 10 these are little bit bigger in size which will be like a dust,
the Nitric dioxide which is one of a component which is normally found in the
atmosphere similarly we also have something called as nitric oxide which is also a component which is
found in the atmosphere, whenever we have too much of nitric oxide there is a higher chance that it's going to be not
healthy either it is nitri oxide Nitric dioxide or Nitric X oxide this is called as Nitric xoxide so whenever these numbers tend to increase which basically
means there is more pollutant in the area similarly there is also something called as NH3 okay NH3 is one of another component
which is lethal which is actually called as ammonia so ammonia actually make a person not to breathe really well and it's also related to a lot of respiratory
illnesses and too much of anonia especially inhaling can also create certain irritation and bronchitis so these are the issues similarly Co that is basically carbon monoxide whenever you are going to take carbon monoxide it is going to kill you slowly unfortunately we cannot identify whether there is carbon monooxide present in atmosphere from our naked Ice until and unless we have a specific meters to read, similarly there is also something called sulfur dioxide so sulfur dioxide is one such element which is going to influence acid rain so even these numbers are also something that always need to be taken care and people might be assuming that ozone is really good but unfortunately if we try to inhale ozone there is a higher chance that a person may not survive so ozone
is also something which need to be only available in the uppermost Hemisphere and if you are going to inhale ozone it can be lethal as well similarly Benzene tolin and deine these are benzes which are also called as formal Deyes as well sometimes these are cogenic in nature this may lead for lung
cancer or these kind of things and all the combination of this there is an index called as aqi which is being
calculated there are certain days where the sensors are not working so that's the reason there are some blank values.
